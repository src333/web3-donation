* CrowdFunding Context Provider
*
* This file was initially based on tutorial code from: Daulat Hussain's Web3.0 Crowdfunding tutorial 
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcXVKkYnu1c&ab_channel=DaulatHussain
*
* Major Enhancements & Modifications by [Sahar Choudhury]:
* - Migrated to Ethers.js v6 syntax
* - Full inline documentation with JSDoc-style comments
* - Integrated admin verification using isAdmin() smart contract method
* - Created context-based logic for conditional rendering (e.g., admin dashboards)
* - also added getAllCampaigns(), updateCampaign(), and deleteCampaign() for admin use
* - Improved error handling, loading states, and UI syncing
* - Refactored async wallet logic to modern standards
* - Extended donation parsing with timestamps for analytics
* - Used best practices for secure interaction with smart contracts
*
* The structure remains similar to the original tutorial, but most logic has been expanded,
* secured, and adapted for advanced use cases.
